# Welcome to CloseAi

## Introduction

- This is the documentation for `CloseAi` our question and answer system that uses OpenAI embeddings and Supabase vector database.
- The document serves as a guide to understanding the system and how to use it effectively.
- `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
- `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.

## Why us?

- Our system provides accurate and relevant answers to user queries.
  It uses OpenAI embeddings to analyze the meaning of user queries and match them with the most relevant answers.
- It also utilizes a Supabase vector database for fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- The system offers a powerful and user-friendly tool for providing accurate and relevant answers to user queries.
- This documentation will provide all the necessary information for using the system effectively.

## What is embeddings?

- In natural language processing, words are represented as numerical vectors called embeddings.
- Embeddings are designed to capture the meaning of words and the relationships between them.
- For example, the word "cat" might be represented as a vector that includes information about its appearance, behavior, and typical environment.
- Similarly, the word "dog" might be represented as a vector that includes information about its appearance, behavior, and typical environment.
- By comparing the embeddings of different words, it's possible to identify relationships between them. For instance, the embeddings for "cat" and "dog" might be similar, indicating that these words are related to each other in some way.
- Embeddings can be generated using various techniques, such as neural networks or dimensionality reduction algorithms.
- In natural language processing applications, embeddings are often used to improve the accuracy of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.

## What is Supabase vector database?

- It is built on top of PostgreSQL, a popular open-source relational database management system.
- It includes specialized indexing and query functionality that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of vector data.
- Supabase vector database is designed to work seamlessly with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as with popular NLP libraries like spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers.
- It is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data, making it ideal for use in applications that involve processing large amounts of text or image data.
- Supabase vector database is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to developers and organizations of all sizes.
- It includes a user-friendly interface and a variety of tools and resources to help developers get started with using the database.

- The video tutorial "Serivcenow Admin" using this create questions. After watching the tutorial, you can customize the system to fit their specific needs and train it on their own data sources.
- Go to **`Home`** page and below section send your query.
- The question and answer system can be used to answer a wide range of questions related to the data sources it is trained on, such as product information, news articles, or historical events
- Users can ask natural language questions, such as "What are the benefits of using Servicenow Admin?" or "How does the Serice Admin works?"
- You may encounter limitations or challenges in using the OpenAI embeddings and Supabase vector database, such as the need for large amounts of training data or limitations in the accuracy of the model.
- However, with careful tuning and customization, the question and answer system can provide a highly effective way to access and analyze large volumes of data.
- Only ask question related this video.
